## How to play the game

To start the game just open the index.html file.

The game is a typical game of memory. Try to find matching cards. If you can finish the game with less then 13 moves you'll get 3 stars. Less then 19 moves and you'll get 2 stars. More than that you'll get 1 star. In addition to your amount of moves, the time is beeing tracked.

After you won the amount of moves and the time you needed will be displayed.
To restart the game just click the restart button.

The basics for this game was given by Udacity (https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).
What I did is make the game interactive(mainly in js/app.js)
